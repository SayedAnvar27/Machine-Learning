# Olympic History Prediction with Machine Learning
This project aims to predict the likelihood of winning a medal in the Olympics based on historical data, utilizing classification algorithms and cross-validation techniques.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize machine learning algorithms to predict whether a country will win a medal in the Olympics based on historical data. The dataset includes information about countries, sports, athletes, and medal outcomes across various Olympic events.

## Algorithms Used

We employed the following classification algorithms:

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- KNN
- GaussianNB

## Cross-Fold Validation

Cross-fold validation is used to assess the performance of each algorithm. This helps in evaluating the model's ability to generalize to unseen data and i choose best two algorithms 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project containing information such as country details, sports events, and medal outcomes across multiple Olympic Games.

## Accuracy Scores

The accuracy scores and r2,mae,mse scores for each algorithm are as follows:

- Random Forest: XX%
- KNN: XX%

These scores demonstrate the effectiveness of each algorithm in predicting Olympic medal outcomes.

## Predictions

We also provide predictions for random values based on the trained models to showcase their predictive capabilities.

## Visualizations

Visualizations play a crucial role in understanding the data and model performance. We use matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn to create the following plots:

- Bar charts to show medal counts by sports and which year which sports are contacting.
-hetmap visualization using for Prediction datas values
